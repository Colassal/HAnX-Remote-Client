# HAnX-Remote-Client
A windows client for connecting to sys-netcheat nintendo switch homebrew. This does not contain sys-netcheat, you will need to use the github page to set that up first this is only for communicating from a windows pc to the switch.

sys-netcheat github page: https://github.com/jakibaki/sys-netcheat

1) Run HAnX_RemoteConnect.Exe (Probably needs admin privledges - just saying)
2) Chose the first option to enter your switch's IP Address and port
3) Wait for it to let you know it is connected
4) Enter commands as listed on the sys-netcheat github page
5) Profit!

A UI with address saving and more memory editor like features is planned (some things may be limited on the sys-netcheat end, but jakibaki has made a pretty freakin great sys module so make sure to give him thanks!).

I only have abut 2-3 hours to dedicate on weekends - with some time on weekdays. If you are interested in improving the code please feel free to submit pull requests and I will work to merge them as fast as I can.

This is very much a WIP, my code is less than stellar and I am not responsible for any unintended issues this may cause including but not limited to:

Crashing your computer
Bricking your Switch
Making your printer want blood
Creating Nuclear arms
Gaining sentience and hunting Sarah Connor
(You get my point)
